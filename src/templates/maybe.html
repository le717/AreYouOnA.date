<h2>Maybe&hellip;?</h2>
<p>It is possible that you are on a date but we are not positive about it. Complicating factors include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The location of your date</li>
  <li>The quality (ðŸ’²ðŸ’²) of the date location</li>
  <li>Being a college student and only being able to have simple dates due to time and money</li>
  <li>Not having the person's explict word that is this indeed a date</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Just because we cannot figure out if you're on a date doesn't mean you are not on a date. We all make mistakes at times.
  If this really is a date, feel free to ignore us. Go ahead and enjoy your date. We won't bother you.
</p>

<div class="extra-msg">
  <h2>Sooooooo&hellip;</h2>
  <p>
    Because we are not sure that you are on a date, you could <a href="{{ url_for('date.index') }}">try again</a> and perhaps we'll get it right this time.
    If we're completely wrong and you actually are on a date, please accept our apology and a
    <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://le717.github.io/did-a-thing/?name=you">small token of our appreciation</a> for being on a date.
