  <p>If for some <em>weird</em> reason you have reason to believe that the assessment is in error regarding your date status or are in shock that you are actually on a really for real date, you can always <a href="{{ url_for('date.index') }}">run the assessment again</a> to confirm that you're still on a date. That being said, we don't know why you would do that. You are on a date. Just go with it and don't look a gifted horse in the mouth (whatever that saying means Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯).</p>
