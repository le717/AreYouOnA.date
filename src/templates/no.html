<h2>No.</h2>
<p>How was this determined? Quite simply, really. Try asking yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Did you fail to previously arrange with the person for this to be a date?</li>
  <li>Did you ask someone who is not sitting at the table if this is a date?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can answer "yes" to any one of questions, then you are not on a date. Sorry to break your heart like that. ðŸ’”</p>

<div class="geo-msg">
  <h2>By the way&hellip;</h2>
  <p>You denied location access when visiting this site. That can provide an inaccurate assesment as well. If you would like a potentially more accurate assesment, <a href="{{ url_for('date.index') }}">re-run the assessment</a> and allow access to your location. Your location will be used solely to evaluate your date status and nothing more. Promise.</p>
