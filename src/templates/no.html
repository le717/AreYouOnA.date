<h2>No.</h2>
<p>How was this determined? Quite simply, really. Try asking yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Did you fail to previously arrange with the person for this to be a date?</li>
  <li>Did you ask someone who is not sitting at your table if this is a date?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can answer "yes" to any one of questions, then you are not on a date. Sorry to break your heart like that. ðŸ’”</p>

  <p>We were unable to access your current location, either because it's not supported on your device or you denied access. We are unable to assess your date status without it. If you would like us to actually perform the assesment, <a href="{{ url_for('date.index') }}">re-run the assessment</a> and permit access to your location. We promise not to misuse it.</p>
